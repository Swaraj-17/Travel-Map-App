Travel Map - Full-stack Map Pinning Travel App
This project is a full-stack travel application that allows users to pin their locations on a map, share their reviews, and interact with other users. The application utilizes React.js, Node.js, Mapbox, Express, and MongoDB to provide a seamless and interactive travel experience.

Features
React.js: The front-end of the application is built using React.js. It offers a modern and responsive user interface, providing an engaging experience for users.

Node.js & Express: The back-end of the application is powered by Node.js and Express, creating a robust server that handles API requests and database operations.

Mapbox: The application integrates Mapbox, a popular mapping platform, to display the interactive map and enable users to pin their locations.

MongoDB & Mongoose: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store and manage user data, pins, and reviews. Mongoose is employed as the object modeling tool for MongoDB, simplifying the interaction with the database.

Application Walkthrough
The development of this travel map application is broken down into several tutorial videos. Here's a brief overview of the main sections covered in these videos:

Creating Node.js Express App: A Node.js and Express server is set up to serve the application and handle API requests.

Connecting MongoDB with Mongoose: The application establishes a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, allowing data to be stored and retrieved from the database.

Creating Node.js Rest API: The RESTful API endpoints are defined to handle user authentication, pin creation, and review submission.

Node.js Login and Register System: A user login and registration system is implemented on the server-side to manage user authentication.

Creating a React App: The React application is created, providing the foundation for the front-end development.

Using React Mapbox: Mapbox integration is set up within the React app, enabling the display of the interactive map.

Creating Mapbox Marker: Pins are implemented on the map using Mapbox markers, allowing users to pin their locations.

Creating Mapbox Popup: Interactive popups are added to the pins, displaying additional information and reviews.

React Fetching data from Node.js using Axios: Data is fetched from the server using Axios, enabling the display of pins and reviews on the React app.

React Mapbox adding new Location: Users can add new locations by interacting with the map and creating new pins.

React Post request using Axios: The React app sends post requests to the server to store new pins and reviews in the database.

React Login and Register Page: The front-end includes login and registration pages, allowing users to authenticate and access the application.

Mern Stack Login and Register System: The complete MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack login and registration system is implemented, providing a seamless user experience.

Using React Local Storage: Local storage is utilized within the React app to store user session data and maintain user authentication status.

React Logout System using Local Storage: Users can log out from the application, with the logout system utilizing local storage for session management.
